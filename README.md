## Overview
 




## Bussiness Problem 
MRI imaging is an essential step in diagnosing and categroizing types of tumors in patients.  Too image brain tumors with an MRI, hundreds of images are produced for an individual patient.  These images need expert analysis from a radiologist and a neurologist to identify and determine the type of tumor.  This process is time consuming and relies on the access to the high calibur doctors. To expediate diagnosis and broaden the accesability of accurate classification, a properly trained CNN can be used to classify different types of tumors and act as a preliminary diagnosostic tool.  In this study I plan to answer the following questions:
 1. Can a CNN classify tumors into four classes (glioma tumors, menigioma tumors, pituitary tumors and no tumors)
 2. What CNN architecture reduces the highest amount of false negatives/ has the highest recall
 3. What are the key features of each tumor class that is identified by the classification CNN
